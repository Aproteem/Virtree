# Virtree
This is my personal project where I can grow a tree on my iPhone

## Inspiration:
Life tree app, and quittr app tree section. TBF, my main motivation is that I liked the concept of having a tree grow to signify streaks. As long as the streak grows, so does my tree
I will start off with a very simple app, one that only has features like 
-planting the tree (day 1)
-tree grows(as i complete a task or check a habit)
-The user can select whether a missing streak is a soft punishment or hard
--soft is treated as not watering the plant
--hard is treated as uprooting the plant

---This will be the feature limit for now, I will implement more later as the main goal of this project is getting out of tutorial hell and building a deployable app first.
